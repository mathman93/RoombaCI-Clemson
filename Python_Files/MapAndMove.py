''' MapAndMove.py
Purpose: Draws a virtual map with the origin and the coordinates given, and moves from the start to its goal. Also adds points that it bumps into to the map as walls
	that it will attempt to move around to get to the goal, and keep the walls in memory for its movement in the future
